# (K)nock: a 2D physics game

Knock is a 2D physics game meant to be a first release. It basically involves knocking a box around a very simplistic stage and that is about it. I am working on it as a secondary project, so I have not gotten much done yet, but I hope that will change soon.

## pepino

Note: Unlike other Decentix games this one is not based on Melon TK. Since the game is so small I will probably write single-file pepino in C and use it here. For example `pp_mesh`, `pp_gui` and etc.

## asset distribution

For storing files I should probably just make a small uncompressed format since the game would probably do best with that..
